# SIX 

## Core Concept

SIX maps your social network using your phone contacts and creates a hierarchical connection system:

- **1¬∞ Connections**: Your direct contacts
- **2¬∞ Connections**: Mutual connections (people who know both you and your contacts)
- **3¬∞ Connections**: Friends of mutuals (extended network)

This approach ensures that every connection has a mutual foundation, making interactions more meaningful and trustworthy.
